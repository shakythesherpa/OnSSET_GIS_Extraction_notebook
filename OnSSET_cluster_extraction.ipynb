    "This is the GEP-OnSSET GIS extraction notebook. This is supposed to act as a complement to the QGIS plugins available [here](https://github.com/global-electrification-platform/Cluster-based_extraction_OnSSET/tree/master/Plugin). \n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of this notebook is to facilitate the change of single datasets without running through the entire plugin. Using this notebook the user will be able to change however many datasets needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run an OnSSET analysis the following datasets are needed:\n",
    "* Land Cover\n",
    "* Elevation \n",
    "* Slope\n",
    "* Global horizontal irradiation\n",
    "* Travel time\n",
    "* Wind velocity\n",
    "* Clusters **(these clusters should include: The name of the study area, the amount of nighttime lights, population, population living in areas with nighttime light and an ID column)**. The clusters can be downloaded from [Energydata.info](https://energydata.info/) or generated directly using the [following plugin](https://github.com/global-electrification-platform/Clustering)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to this there are also some optional datasets that can be used in the analysis:\n",
    "* Custom Demand - A layer that can be created by the users themselves. For the first round of GEP the methodlogy described [here](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/7/1395) has been used.\n",
    "* Substations\n",
    "* Transformers\n",
    "* Mini/Small hydro\n",
    "* Existing and planned HV-lines\n",
    "* Existing and planned MV-lines \n",
    "* Road network\n",
